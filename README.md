# Freight-Locations-and-Rail-Path-Dashboard

## Overview
This project is a **map-based freight intelligence dashboard** built to visualise and explore **freight-related infrastructure and activity** across a large UK region.

The application enables users to interactively explore:
- Existing freight locations  
- Planned freight infrastructure  
- Areas of increased freight activity  
- Strategic freight rail paths  

The tool is designed to support **strategic planning, policy development, and infrastructure analysis** using a clear, map-first interface.
